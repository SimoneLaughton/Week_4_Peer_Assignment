# Codebook Information - Week 4 Assignment 

This is an R Markdown document that includes the codebook information for the file tidydata.txt, which is the resulting file after applying run_analysis.R to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI) Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset.  The creation of this Codebook is one of the requirements for the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Peer Review assignment.

As noted in the README.txt file for the data, "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details" (Anguita, Ghio, Oneto, Parra & Reyes-Ortiz (2013).

## Codebook for the resulting Tidy Data File (tidydata.txt) includes the following:

### Rows
- 1 header row
- 180 rows of data including subject, activity, and 86 average measurements for means and standard deviations related to each subject and activity

### Columns

- 88 columns including:

#### Column #1 - subject

- Total number of subjects (Note: subject = participant or person) = 30
- The subjects are numbered from 1 to 30. 
- Each number represents a unique subject.
- The subjects were between 19 - 48 years of age.
- Each subject has 6 rows of measurements.

#### Column #2 - activity 

- Total number of activities for each subject = 6

Note:  Measurements were taken for each subject for each of the 6 activities.  As noted in the activities_labels.txt file, the labels for the activities are: 

- 1 WALKING
- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- 4 SITTING
- 5 STANDING
- 6 LAYING

#### Columns #3 - 88 - average measurements for each subject and activity

As noted in the file features_info.txt, "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise."

The following is a legend of the meaning for the letters in the variable names.

- t = time
- f = frequency domain signals
- acc = accelerometer
- gyro = gyroscope
- body = body
- jerk = jerk signals
- mag = magnitude
- freq = frequency
- angle = angle between two vectors
- mean = mean
- std = standard deviation

Note:  Measurements were taken for X, Y, and Z axes

#### Columns #3 - 14
